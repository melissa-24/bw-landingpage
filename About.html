<h1>About Potluck Planner</h1>

<!-- Main Page Information About App -->
<p>We have all had a potluck where people forgot what day it was so they didn't bring their choosen dish. What happens when you have mutiple people bringing the same sides? Heaven forbid someone forget they are suppose to bring the drinks. It was for these very reasons as well as many more why our team have designed this very app. Potluck planner takes the stress and headache of the whole potluck event. This app allows people to see the date on their calender, signup with what dish they are going to bring so everything that is needed is filled, and even to confirm when someone is going to attend. It also give the user the ability to invite people, and even suggest the dishes that people might want to bring incase they are unsure. Oh no, half of the church as Corona and is sick what about all of the other churches that were going to come for the rivial? Have no fear the Potluck Planner is here! This app allows you to change the time, date, and location so that everyone knows the updated information. Any problems that could occur we have you covered!</p>
